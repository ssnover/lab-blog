It's getting close to the holiday season and so I was looking at options for getting back home and-- No... No. This is a rant. Not a calmly reasoned blog post. A rant.

I took Amtrak one-way home for the holidays last year from Denver, CO to Buffalo, NY. It was quite a bit cheaper than flying, I had never taken a train long distance in the US, and I feel guilty about the amount of emissions I produce by flying to the east coast all the time. So I took Amtrak. And it was miserable. It took a day and a half and I got hardly any sleep during my two nights sleeping in my seat in coach.

So this afternoon I'm looking at traveling east again. Maybe I take what I learned (overnight in coach sucks, Lake Shore Limited sucks) and try again. I'm headed towards Baltimore first which might have better options. Maybe the lines will be faster due to proximity to the Northeast corridor. Maybe if I'm a bit of ahead of normal holiday travel I'll have it easier.

Nope. Nope. Nope. And nope.

First of all, choice of seats. Coach sucks. The seats are more comfortable than the ones on a plane thankfully with significantly more leg room. But you're in them for 18 hours for the leg from Denver to Chicago. So perhaps roomettes are better? I will never know because the price jumps from $186 to $1100 for a roomette. At which point I'll just forget it.

Then there's the matter of the speed and distances involved. I can forgive the lack of infrastructure investment between Denver and Chicago. There's not much in between to drive a lot of traffic on the route. But between Chicago and DC (the next transfer), there's many fairly large cities to serve with a high speed route. The distance is 800 miles; passing through Indianapolis, Columbus, and Pittsburgh. Google Maps tells me that it takes about 12 hours to drive. Amtrak gives 18 hours as the total time for this leg. EIGHTEEN HOURS! That's an average speed of 45 mph.

This is the result when you let an industry with no incentive to invest in the long term health of the network own the infrastructure. This likely means at-grade crossings more-or-less the whole way, needing to slow down to pass through towns, etc. Let's compare with [a route built in Spain and for which service began before I was born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renfe#Operations): Madrid to Seville has an operating speed of 190 mph. It's obviously not traveling at that speed the entire time, but it's clearly going much faster. Google shows a trip time of 2 hours and 40 minutes by train and a driving distance of about 300 miles. Even if we're generous for the extra distance and stops and divide the average speed by 1.2, that still comes out to 8.5 hours for the whole trip from Chicago to DC or an average speed of 94 mph. That's to say nothing of the options; Amtrak runs two direct trains from Chicago to DC per day and Renfe runs 17 direct trains from Madrid to Seville per day.

Passenger rail in the US is abysmal. It means many Americans own cars who shouldn't have to. It means many Americans fly when they shouldn't have to. This a proven technology that can decarbonize the transportation sector, but all anyone wants to talk about are electric cars and, if they're drinking Elon Musk's kool-aid, the Hyperloop. As long as that's happening, the climate is toast.

If all of the above also irks you, I don't have anything all that actionable for you at the end of this rant, but I can at least point you towards more resources to be more informed:
