The purpose of this engineering blog is two-fold:

* I frequently do a lot of research to solve a very specific problem and then 
later on have to do it all over again because I didn't write anything down. It'd
be great if I didn't have to do that and an even better outcome is if I can save
someone else some of their time.
* I learned so much of what I know from reading blogs, reddit posts, e-mail
newsletters, and twitter threads from knowledgeable people. Writing an
occasional post about what I'm working on feels like a way to start paying it
forward. I'd like to dive into this more with posts that could eventually take
one "skill tree" style through a lot of engineering DIY, we'll see where that
train of thought goes.

If anything I write here helps you, I'm not taking donations for coffee or 
otherwise, but if you sent me an e-mail letting me know which post was
especially helpful, I'll probably glow for at least a week!

Thanks for reading!
